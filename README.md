# Archlinux repo-add drone.io plugin

The goal of this repository is to provide [drone.io plugins](http://plugins.drone.io/) performing a Archlinux [repo-add](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/repo-add.8.html).

To use them, read the [drone.io docs](https://readme.drone.io). The plugin names are formatted as  `mydatakeeper/drone-repo-add:ARCH` where ARCH is one of the available tag.
